# decisiontree
This project uses the Decision Tree Regression algorithm to predict cost of housing using the Boston dataset. It calculates training and testing error(mean squared error) for different training sample sizes. It also calculates error rates for different depths of the tree and chooses the best depth parameter using Grid Search Cross-validation.
